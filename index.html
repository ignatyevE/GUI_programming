            The contents make it so that the user can go to any specific assignment on the page, as well as back to the top of the page. For this reason, each individual assignment has an ID to make this possible. Assignments where it applies have blockquotes quoting the assignment pdfs, as well as have iframes to quickly show the website in question without going to it.

                        In this assignment you will create your first web page. That may sound easy, but there are a number of pieces involved in getting yourself and your account ready for the more complex assignments to follow. To complete this assignment successfully, your first webpage must be visible to everyone on the weblab.cs.uml.edu server.
