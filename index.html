                        In this assignment you will create your first web page. That may sound easy, but there are a number of pieces involved in getting yourself and your account ready for the more complex assignments to follow. To complete this assignment successfully, your first webpage must be visible to everyone on the weblab.cs.uml.edu server.

                    <p>This assignment was to create a form that takes a numerical range for a multiplicand and multiplier and then create a multiplication table from those values.
                        This assignment also required form validation, of which it is in real-time.

                    <p>This assignment was to take Assignment 6 and use the jQuery validation system instead. Very little has changed from assignment 6 aside from some slight formatting things.

                    <p>This assignment was to take Assignment 7 and implement the jQuery UI controls for the sliders and for the tabs.
                        This assignment was not properly completely, there being an error when the sliders are used to affect the tabbed tables. Instead of editting the current table, it adds another table above it.
